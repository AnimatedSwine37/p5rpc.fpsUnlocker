# P5R FPS Unlocker
A mod that changes the FPS cap in P5R PC.

## FPS Cap
By default the cap is set to a large number (99999) to make the FPS effectively uncapped. 
This value can changed to anything that you want in the mod's configuration.

Note that the game will still respect your V Sync settings so to get a higher FPS than your monitor's refresh rate you should disable V Sync in the game's Display settings.

## Tie Game Speed to FPS
For fun, you can tie the game's speed to its FPS through the mod's configuration. 
**Please do not do this if you are sensitive to flashing lights as things can animate very fast at high FPS!**

I've only included this as I accidentally found out how to do it when developing the mod. If stuff breaks when it is enabled, I will not fix it.
